\begin{itemize}
\item Created at Mozilla in late 2000s and early 2010s

\note{
Rust is commonly described as a "systems programming" language.
To me it's a programming language for people who want to pay more attention
to machine-level details, such as memory layout, instruction counts, and amount of branching.

\medskip

It differs from C in its approach to safety.
Whereas C favours simplicity and performance at the expense of safety, Rust favours
safety and performance at the expense of simplicity.
Rust is a more complex programming language than C, and Rust compilers are harder to
implement than C compilers, because the Rust language and compiler does more for the
programmer.

\onslide<5->\item Writing Haskell in disguise?

\note{
What \emph{is} functional programming?

\medskip

Is it programming with functions? With higher-order functions? With immutable data structures?
Does functional programming just mean, "doing your best to embed a Haskell dialect in your
language of choice"?

\medskip

I'm not going to try to answer this question. I think the question of whether it \emph{is}
anything in particular might be misguided. People have spent a lot of energy debating
what should and shouldn't be considered functional programming, and which languages
should be considered "functional". Right now I don't see much value in an algorithm
that decides what is and isn't "functional".

\medskip

Here's why:

\usebeamerfont{title}{\usebeamercolor[fg]{frametitle}{Personal identity and functional programming}}
\end{center}
\note<+>{
Before I get into the technical details, I want to talk about a use (misuse?) of the
term "functional programming": as a sort of "tribal identity marker". Here's something
true of my experience that might also be true for you:

\medskip

I enjoy spending time with people who have similar interests to me. I like talking about
programming with other programmers (that's why I'm here tonight!), and listening to music
with people who have similar tastes. In situations like these, in a community of sorts,
I feel a kind of satisfaction that I don't feel when I'm alone or with people who are
extremely different to me.

\medskip

I've noticed that if I don't pay enough attention,
I have a tendency to act as if \emph{my} interests / tastes/ preferences are somehow objectively
better than the alternatives.
}

\note<+>{
I've also experienced something kind of toxic that happens when this (usually incorrect)
tendency to think that my choice is Better spreads to the group and becomes part of the
way we bond. We start to celebrate the supposed fact that we are the small group who
made the "right" choice, and start to find meaning in pointing out the ways that everyone
else is "wrong".

\medskip

This is kind of how I related to "functional programming" when I was younger. I enjoyed a
particular style of programming or flavour of programming language, and thought I was
being attracted to some kind of objective superiority. Sometimes I even had a feeling of
\emph{ethical} superiority.
Under those perspectives, at the worst of times, the question of
"is X functional programming?" could be less like
asking, "in which section of the library do we put the book on X?" and more like,
"do I approve of X or is it yucky / weird / other?"

\medskip

I failed to see the ways in which my attraction to "functional programming" was due to
my personal history and my taste in writing software. And I failed to acknowledge the
nebulousity of this "paradigm" which at the time seemed so objective.

\note{
So as an effort of humility, instead of presenting a definition of functional programming
and measuring Rust against it, I'm going cover a few topics that seem most closely
associated to "functional programming" (whatever \emph{that} is), and talk about the
extent to which they show up in Rust.

\medskip

Before I reveal them, I want to do a survey. What are some of the ideas \emph{you} would include?

Rust has sums, which it calls "enums", and products, which it calls "structs".

Enums are examined by pattern matching, and structs by field accessors.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Algebraic datatypes and higher-order functions --- HOFs}

Rust has anonymous functions, known as \emph{closures}.

\begin{columns}

\begin{column}[T]{0.48\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Creation}
\small
\begin{minted}{rust}
let f = |x| x + 1;

\begin{block}{Use}
\small
\begin{minted}{rust}
let y = f(x);
\end{minted}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\end{columns}

\bigskip

\onslide<2->Higher-order functions are fairly common in the standard library.

\onslide<2->\begin{block}{Example: \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/struct.Map.html}{\texttt{map}}}
\begin{minted}{rust}
let xs: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
let ys: Vec<u32> = xs.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Algebraic datatypes and higher-order functions --- HOFs}

Working with closures / HOFs in Rust is more complex than in other languages.

\begin{block}{Haskell}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
map :: (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Rust}
\small
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn map<A, B, F: FnOnce(A) -> B>(
    f: F,
    value: Option<A>
) -> Option<B>

fn map_or<A, B, F: FnOnce(A) -> B>(
    default: B,
    f: F,
    value: Option<A>
) -> B
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c,fragile]
\frametitle{Algebraic datatypes and higher-order functions --- HOFs}

Most languages have a single function type.

\bigskip

Rust has 3 kinds of closure:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnOnce.html}{\texttt{FnOnce}}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html}{\texttt{Fn}}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnMut.html}{\texttt{FnMut}}
\end{itemize}

\note{
Most languages have a single function type. Rust has more. There are 3 kinds of
closure: \texttt{FnOnce}, \texttt{Fn}, and \texttt{FnMut}. I won't explain what they mean
right now.
Let me just say: they are all justified in the context of Rust's goals of safety and
performance. The price of achieving these goals for closures in Rust is simplicity:
when you write a higher-order function, you need to figure out which kind of
higher-order function is most appropriate.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Algebraic datatypes and higher-order functions}

Higher-order functions (in some form or another) seem like an essential component
of "functional programming".

\bigskip

\onslide<2->Algebraic datatypes and higher-order functions are interdefinable:

\begin{itemize}
\onslide<3->\item ADTs via HOFs --- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding}{Church encoding}
\onslide<4->\item HOFs via ADTs --- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defunctionalization}{Defunctionalization}
\end{itemize}

\note{
It seems reasonable to me to claim that higher-order functions are an essential part
of functional programming.

\medskip

I've put algebraic datatypes and higher-order functions in the same section
because they're actually interdefinable. If you have one, then you have the other
(assuming you have first-order function definitions).

\medskip

Using higher-order functions to define algebraic datatypes is called Church encoding.

\medskip

Going the other way, algebraic datatypes (together with first-order functions) to
can be used to define higher-order functions through a method
called Defunctionalisation, which was the subject of Jack's recent talk, "Everything
looks like a function".

\begin{frame}[c,fragile]
\begin{center}
\usebeamerfont{title}{\usebeamercolor[fg]{frametitle}{Immutability}}
\end{center}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Immutability}

Variable bindings in Rust are immutable by default:

\begin{block}{Immutable by default}
\small
\begin{minted}{rust}
let x = 1;
x = x + 1; // error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\bigskip

\onslide<2->Rust allows mutability, which comes in 3 flavours:

\begin{itemize}
\onslide<3->\item Local mutability --- mild
\onslide<4->\item Mutable references --- medium
\onslide<5->\item Interior (hidden) mutability --- spicy
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c,fragile]
\frametitle{\st{Im}Mutability --- Local}

\begin{block}{Local mutability}
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn two() -> u32 {
    let mut x: u32 = 0;
    x += 1;
    x += 1;
    x
}
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\note{
This is the most benign form of mutability because it is compositional. When I call a
function, that function's use of local mutability is not a concern to me.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c,fragile]
\frametitle{\st{Im}Mutability --- References}

\begin{block}{Definition}
\small
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn increment_immutable(x: &u32) {
    *x = x + 1; // error: cannot assign to `*x`, which is
                // behind a `&` reference
}

fn increment_mutable(x: &mut u32) {
    *x = x + 1; // ok
}
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\note{
I've lost some compositionality: if I'm not careful with my design then I could
create a history-sensitive function. A function that only works properly when I
call it in the right place at the right time.

\medskip

The upside is that because the mutability is in the type signature I'm reminded of
this possibility, so I can more consciously opting in to (potential) mutation when
I call such functions.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c,fragile]
\frametitle{\st{Im}Mutability --- References}

\begin{block}{Use}
\small
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn increment_mutable(x: &mut u32) {
    *x = x + 1;
}

let x = 1;
increment_mutable(&x) // error: types differ in mutability

let x = 1;
increment_mutable(&mut x) // error: cannot borrow `x` as mutable,
                          // as it is not declared as mutable
let mut x = 1;
increment_mutable(&mut x) // ok
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\note{
You can only take a mutable reference to a mutable variable. I find adding the
\texttt{mut} keyword to a binding to be a helpful "confirmation" step for mindful
mutability.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{\st{Im}Mutability --- Interior (hidden)}

Some types allow mutation through an "immutable" reference:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html}{\texttt{Cell}}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html}{\texttt{RefCell}}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html}{\texttt{Mutex}}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html}{\texttt{RwLock}}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/}{atomics}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\onslide<2->\begin{tabular}{l l l l}
Type & Better Name & Multiplicity & Writable (\texttt{*x = ..}) \\
\hline
\onslide<3->\texttt{\&T} & Shared reference & Many & No \\
\onslide<4->\texttt{\&mut T} & Exclusive reference & One & Yes
\end{tabular}

\note{    
Some types allow mutation through an "immutable" reference. That's a hint that the
term "immutable reference" is a bit of a misnomer. Instead of talking about "immutable"
and "mutable" references, sometimes it's better to use the terms "shared" and "exclusive",
respectively.

\medskip

Rust prevents data races by only allowing writes via an exclusive reference.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{\st{Im}Mutability --- Interior (hidden)}

\begin{block}{Definition}
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn increment_interior(x: &Cell<u64>) -> u64 {
    let result = x.get() + x.get();
    x.set(x.get(x) + 1);
    result
}
\end{minted}
\end{block}

Mutability is no longer in the type signature.

\begin{block}{Example}
\begin{minted}{rust}
struct S{
    x: Cell<u64>
}

// Does `f_S` mutate its argument?
fn f_S(s: &S) -> { .. }
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\note{
When is interior mutability useful?

\bigskip

It's necessary for thread-shared mutable state, and that's the only time I've used it.
I've never used `Cell` or `RefCell` and I haven't thought about when they'd be justified.

\note{
Reference lifetime analysis, generally known as "borrow checking", determines at compile
time whether a program references data in a safe way.

\medskip

For example, you're allowed to get a refrence to a struct's field, pass it to and return
it from functions, store it in another datatype, etc. and the compiler will prevent you
from doing anything that could cause the reference to outlive the struct. In other words,
no dangling references / use-after-frees.

\note{
You can think of a variable with of a unique type as being a "resource"
that can be consumed by a function. After the resource has been consumed,
it is no longer available for use. Rust calls this "transferring ownership".

Following the "ownership" metaphor, taking a reference is called "borrowing".
(Because ownership is returned once the reference is deleted)

I find unique types extremely interesting because of how they interact with
equational reasoning and mutability, which I will cover later.

\onslide<2->\item Come to Donovan's talk next month!

\note{
There's a deep theoretical reason that types are associated with functional programming.
The lambda calculus is a turing-complete model of computation which consists *only* of
functions. The definitive functional programming language. There are ways of defining
type systems for the lambda calculus that are equivalent to mathematical logics. In this
setting, a type is equivalent to a proposition, and a well-typed lambda calculus program
is a proof of that proposition. This is known as the Curry-Howard correspondence and I
think Donovan will be covering it in more detail next month. 

\medskip

Given this, some people might suggest that a functional programming language is one
that corresponds to a logic via Curry-Howard.

\medskip

The validity of "types as propositions and proofs as programs" for a programming
language requires type checking of that language to be decidable.

\medskip

Rust's type checker is known to be undecidable. It's possible to write Rust programs
that would take an infinite amount of time to type check. I think it's nearly impossible
in a typical software engineering context.

\note{
You use equational reasoning whenever you factor out an expression
or function, and when you go the other way by inlining.

\medskip

Equational reasoning also comes up whenever you simpilify or optimise
code. Optimisations are equations between programs where one side of
the equation has a lower "cost" than the other side.

It's a really important concept!

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Equational reasoning in Rust}

Equational reasoning fails when expressions depend on an implicit context.

\begin{block}{Example 1 --- read}
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn f(x: &mut u32) -> u32 { *x + 1 }

let x: &mut u32 = ..;
f(x)
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Example 2 --- read-write}
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn f(x: &mut u32) -> u32 { *x += 1; 0 }

let x: &mut u32 = ..;
f(x)
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\note{
An expression that depends on an implicit context can evaluate to different results at
different points in the program.

\medskip

In example 1, the expression \texttt{f(x)}, applying the same function to the same reference,
could return different values at different points in the program. It depends on an
implicit mutable store.

\medskip

An expression that \emph{changes} an implicit context is not safe to inline, even if it
returns the same result every time --- see example 2. Inlining such expressions can change the meaning
of the program, because the program's meaning depends on how many times the expression
is evaluated.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Equational reasoning in Rust}
Widespread equational reasoning is not a design goal for Rust.

\medskip

Many standard library functions are non-pure / have side-effects, e.g.:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/index.html}{Standard input / output}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/index.html}{Environment variables}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/index.html}{File system access}
\item \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/index.html}{Networking}
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
\item An expression whose evaluation does not depend on an implicit context is described
as \emph{pure}.

\item A function that doesn't depend on an implicit context is a \emph{pure function}.

\item Changes to an implicit context are called \emph{side-effects}.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\note{
Mutable memory isn't the only implicit context in Rust programs. There is also the
program input / output, environment variables, file system, networking, among others.

\medskip

In Rust, the level of equational reasoning in a codebase depends on the programmers' judgement.
When writing new code, the author decides whether or not equational reasoning is relevant.
When refactoring, the programmer has to understand whether they are working with pure
or non-pure functions.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Equational reasoning and mutability}

Mutability doesn't always break equational reasoning.

\begin{block}{A pure function that uses mutability}
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    let mut counter = y;
    let mut result = x;
    
    while counter > 0 {
        counter -= 1;
        result += 1;
    }
    
    result
}
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\note{
I've showed a bunch of examples where mutability, in particular mutable references, breaks
equational reasoning. But mutability isn't \emph{intrinsically} opposed to equational reasoning.

\medskip

Here's an example of a pure function that uses mutability internally. Equational reasoning
still holds.

A unique variable is only in scope while it's guaranteed to remain unchanged.

\begin{block}{Example}
\begin{minted}{rust}
fn push<T>(mut xs: Vec<T>, x: T) -> Vec<T> { .. }

fn length<T>(xs: &Vec<T>) -> usize { .. }

let xs = vec![1, 2, 3]
// `xs` is immutable...
let new_xs = push(xs, 4); // ...until we actually change it
.. // after which we can no longer refer to `xs`
\end{minted}
\end{block}

\note{
I find this intriguing. \texttt{push} is a non-pure function that
doesn't break equational reasoning. When you have a static type system,
purity is sufficient, but not necessary for equational reasoning.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\note<+>{
What is functional programming? I'm still going to refrain from a definition.

\bigskip

But I have a final observation to share. These four points I've discussed include
specific tools we use to write programs (language features), styles of code (preference
for immutability or mutability), and ways of reasoning about code. 

\bigskip

I think this isn't a coincidence: it seems to me that functional programming is largely
concerned with programs themselves, and the process of programming, as objects of study.
It is less concerned with the specific behaviours of any particular program.

\bigskip

Another way to put it is that FP seems to focus on the relationship between programmers
and programs, rather than the relationship between programs and the world.

\bigskip

I think this is super important and is also inherently risky. It means that the subject
of FP, like other reflective / meta-level subjects, is especially prone to "navel-gazing".
}

\note<+>{
If functional programming is less concerned with specific program behaviours, then it's
a necessarily incomplete answer to the question of how to create good software. I don't
think FP is going to tell me about the appropriate memory / CPU usage bounds for a program
and how to achieve them. Or how to create intuitive user interfaces or render photorealistic
3D graphics or make sure a drone stays level when it flies.

\bigskip

I think that in the past my definition of "good software" was missing a few dimensions,
which lead to me overestimating the important of "functional programming" in "good software".
Now I know that FP isn't a panacea and it doesn't have to be. Whatever it is, it's now one
of many tools of thought for pushing my software along a few of many dimensions of "good".
And that's awesome, because learning's fun and there's even more to learn!
